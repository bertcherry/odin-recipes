    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a more ambitious recipe, but well worth the time. Make sure you let the dough chill during each fold step for a flaky, complex texture!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Proof</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tsp yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1.5T sugar</li>
        <li>3/4c 110 degree water</li>
        <li>6c flour</li>
        <li>3T sugar</li>
        <li>3 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1.5c tepid milk</li>
        <li>10T oil</li>
        <li>5 sticks (1.25lb) butter</li>
        <li>egg for wash</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the yeast, 3/4 tsp salt, 1.5T sugar, and water together as the proof.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, 3T sugar, 3 tsp salt together, then add milk and oil.</li>
        <li>Add proof to the dough, let rise in the fridge for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pound/roll the butter into a circle between two sheets of plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>After the first rise, roll the dough into a sheet and place the butter flat in the center. Fold the dough over like an envelope.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough back out into a sheet, then fold it in thirds twice. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 6 two more times.</li>
        <li>Roll the sheet to ~1/4" thick, cut and shapeinto rolls. Place on tray and let rise for 1 more hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Paint the croissants with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Back at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 375 degrees and bake for another 15 minutes until golden brown. Turn the trays often for an even bake.</li>
    </ol>
